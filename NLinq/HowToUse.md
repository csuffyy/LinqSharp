### How to try it?

Firstly, you should install the **SimpleData** package through **Nuget**.

The **SimpleData** package provides a simple database of **Sqlite** and code first definitions of **Northwnd**.

```powershell
install-package SimpleData
```

And, you can use this simple database to test your own queries. Just like this:

```C#
using (var sqlite = new NorthwndContext(SimpleSources.NorthwndOptions))
{
    var query = sqlite.Employees.Where(x => x.City == "London");
    var sql = query.ToSql();
}
```

If you want to get the generated SQL string, you can use **ToSql()**. This method is defined in **Dawnx**. The above query is:

```sqlite
SELECT "x"."EmployeeID", "x"."Address", "x"."BirthDate", "x"."City", "x"."Country", "x"."Extension", "x"."FirstName", "x"."HireDate", "x"."HomePhone", "x"."LastName", "x"."Notes", "x"."Photo", "x"."PhotoPath", "x"."PostalCode", "x"."Region", "x"."ReportsTo", "x"."Title", "x"."TitleOfCourtesy"
FROM "Employees" AS "x"
WHERE "x"."City" = 'London';
```



### Use simple database (Northwnd)

The Entity Framework provides some basic query extensions, but use it to develop business applications is not simple enough. So, we provide more query extensions to help developers to solve their business problems.

First of all, "**DbContext sqlite**" is defined as:

```C#
var sqlite = new NorthwndContext(SqliteOptions);
```

The source of database is "**%userprofile%/.nuget/simpledata/{version}/source/northwnd.db**".



### Extension Simples

- **WhereSearch**

  Queries records which is contains the specified string in one or any fields.

  For example, if you want to query ***Sweet*** in the field ***Description*** (table **Categories**):

  ```C#
  sqlite.Employees.WhereSearch("Steven", x => x.First_Name);
  ```

  This invoke will generate a SQL query string:

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."CategoryID", "x"."CategoryName", "x"."Description", "x"."Picture"
  FROM "Categories" AS "x"
  WHERE instr("x"."FirstName", 'Steven') > 0;
  ```

  ----

  And, if you want to query ***An*** in the field ***FirstName*** or ***LastName*** (table ***employees***):

  ```C#
  sqlite.Employees.WhereSearch("An", x => new { x.FirstName, x.LastName })
  ```

  The SQL is:

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."EmployeeID", "x"."Address", "x"."BirthDate", "x"."City", "x"."Country", "x"."Extension", "x"."FirstName", "x"."HireDate", "x"."HomePhone", "x"."LastName", "x"."Notes", "x"."Photo", "x"."PhotoPath", "x"."PostalCode", "x"."Region", "x"."ReportsTo", "x"."Title", "x"."TitleOfCourtesy"
  FROM "Employees" AS "x"
  WHERE (instr("x"."FirstName", 'An') > 0) OR (instr("x"."LastName", 'An') > 0);
  ```

  ----

  As you see, this method supports some abilities to search single string in more than one field.

  In some complex scenarios, we also allowed you to query a string in any table which is connected by foreign keys.

  For example, if you want to query who sold product to customer ***QUICK***:

  ```c#
  sqlite.Employees.WhereSearch("QUICK", x => x.Orders.Select(o => o.CustomerID));
  ```

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."EmployeeID", "x"."Address", "x"."BirthDate", "x"."City", "x"."Country", "x"."Extension", "x"."FirstName", "x"."HireDate", "x"."HomePhone", "x"."LastName", "x"."Notes", "x"."Photo", "x"."PhotoPath", "x"."PostalCode", "x"."Region", "x"."ReportsTo", "x"."Title", "x"."TitleOfCourtesy"
  FROM "Employees" AS "x"
  WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM "Orders" AS "o"
      WHERE (instr("o"."CustomerID", 'QUICK') > 0) AND ("x"."EmployeeID" = "o"."EmployeeID"));
  ```

  ----

  In addition, we may also need to use some other special queries. For example, if you want to search for another string in many fields.

  This is an example of querying ***ToFu*** and ***pkg*** in the fields ***ProductName*** and ***QuantityPerUnit***.

  ```c#
  sqlite.Products.WhereSearch(new[] { "Tofu", "pkg" }, x => new 
  { 
  	x.ProductName, x.QuantityPerUnit
  })
  ```

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."ProductID", "x"."CategoryID", "x"."Discontinued", "x"."ProductName", "x"."QuantityPerUnit", "x"."ReorderLevel", "x"."SupplierID", "x"."UnitPrice", "x"."UnitsInStock", "x"."UnitsOnOrder"
  FROM "Products" AS "x"
  WHERE ((instr("x"."ProductName", 'Tofu') > 0) OR (instr("x"."QuantityPerUnit", 'Tofu') > 0)) AND ((instr("x"."ProductName", 'pkg') > 0) OR (instr("x"."QuantityPerUnit", 'pkg') > 0));
  ```

- **WhereMatch**
  Different from **WhereSearch**, this statement will perform an exact match:

  ```mssql
  /* SQL Server */
  SELECT [x].[Id], [x].[First_Name], [x].[Last_Name]
  FROM [Emplyees] AS [x]
  WHERE [x].[First_Name] = N'Bill' 
  	OR [x].[Last_Name] = N'Bill'
  ```

  ```mysql
  /* MySql */
  SELECT `x`.`Id`, `x`.`First_Name`, `x`.`Last_Name`
  FROM `Emplyees` AS `x`
  WHERE `x`.`First_Name` = 'Bill' 
  	OR `x`.`Last_Name` = 'Bill'
  ```

- **WhereBetween**
  Queries records which is start at a specified time and end at another time.

  Note: Support type **Nullable\<DateTime\>**: If member expression's result is null, then the main expression's result is false. Here is the simple:

  ```c#
  sqlite.Employees.WhereBetween(x => x.BirthDate, 
  	new DateTime(1960, 5, 1), new DateTime(1960, 5, 31));
  ```

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."EmployeeID", "x"."Address", "x"."BirthDate", "x"."City", "x"."Country", "x"."Extension", "x"."FirstName", "x"."HireDate", "x"."HomePhone", "x"."LastName", "x"."Notes", "x"."Photo", "x"."PhotoPath", "x"."PostalCode", "x"."Region", "x"."ReportsTo", "x"."Title", "x"."TitleOfCourtesy"
  FROM "Employees" AS "x"
  WHERE CASE
      WHEN "x"."BirthDate" IS NOT NULL
      THEN CASE
          WHEN ('1960-05-01 00:00:00' <= "x"."BirthDate") AND ("x"."BirthDate" <= '1960-05-31 00:00:00')
          THEN CAST(1 AS BIT) ELSE CAST(0 AS BIT)
      END ELSE CAST(0 AS BIT)
  END = 1;
  ```

- **WhereBefore**

- **WhereAfter**

- **WhereMax**
  Selects the entire record with the largest value for a field.

- **WhereMin**
  Selects the entire record with the smallest value for a field.

- **OrderByCase**
  Queries records and order the result by a specified sequence.

  ```c#
  sqlite.Regions
  	.OrderByCase(x => x.RegionDescription, 
      	new[] { "Northern", "Eastern", "Western", "Southern" });
  ```

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."RegionID", "x"."RegionDescription"
  FROM "Region" AS "x"
  ORDER BY CASE
      WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Northern'
      THEN 0 ELSE CASE
          WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Eastern'
          THEN 1 ELSE CASE
              WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Western'
              THEN 2 ELSE CASE
                  WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Southern'
                  THEN 3 ELSE 4
              END
          END
      END
  END;
  ```

- **OrderByCaseDescending**
  Same as **OrderByCase**, but use descending order.

- **ThenByCase**

  ```c#
  sqlite.Regions
  	.OrderByCase(x => x.RegionDescription, 
      	new[] { "Northern", "Eastern", "Western", "Southern" })
      .ThenByCase(x => x.RegionID, new[] { 4, 3, 2, 1 })
  ```

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."RegionID", "x"."RegionDescription"
  FROM "Region" AS "x"
  ORDER BY CASE
      WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Northern'
      THEN 0 ELSE CASE
          WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Eastern'
          THEN 1 ELSE CASE
              WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Western'
              THEN 2 ELSE CASE
                  WHEN "x"."RegionDescription" = 'Southern'
                  THEN 3 ELSE 4
              END
          END
      END
  END, CASE
      WHEN "x"."RegionID" = 4
      THEN 0 ELSE CASE
          WHEN "x"."RegionID" = 3
          THEN 1 ELSE CASE
              WHEN "x"."RegionID" = 2
              THEN 2 ELSE CASE
                  WHEN "x"."RegionID" = 1
                  THEN 3 ELSE 4
              END
          END
      END
  END;
  ```

- **ThenByCaseDescending**
  Same as **ThenByCase**, but use descending order.

- **WhereOr**

  ```C#
  sqlite.Employees.WhereOr(sqlite.Employees
  	.GroupBy(x => x.TitleOfCourtesy)
  	.Select(g => new
  	{
  		TitleOfCourtesy = g.Key,
  		BirthDate = g.Max(x => x.BirthDate),
  	}));
  ```

  This invoke will generated two SQL string, the first is:

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "x"."TitleOfCourtesy", MAX("x"."BirthDate") AS "BirthDate"
  FROM "Employees" AS "x"
  GROUP BY "x"."TitleOfCourtesy";
  ```

  the follow SQL will use all the field of the first result as it's where condition. So, the follow SQL string is:

  ```sqlite
  SELECT "e"."EmployeeID", "e"."Address", "e"."BirthDate", "e"."City", "e"."Country", "e"."Extension", "e"."FirstName", "e"."HireDate", "e"."HomePhone", "e"."LastName", "e"."Notes", "e"."Photo", "e"."PhotoPath", "e"."PostalCode", "e"."Region", "e"."ReportsTo", "e"."Title", "e"."TitleOfCourtesy"
  FROM "Employees" AS "e"
  WHERE (((("e"."TitleOfCourtesy" = 'Dr.') AND ("e"."BirthDate" = '1952-02-19 00:00:00')) OR (("e"."TitleOfCourtesy" = 'Mr.') AND ("e"."BirthDate" = '1963-07-02 00:00:00'))) OR (("e"."TitleOfCourtesy" = 'Mrs.') AND ("e"."BirthDate" = '1937-09-19 00:00:00'))) OR (("e"."TitleOfCourtesy" = 'Ms.') AND ("e"."BirthDate" = '1966-01-27 00:00:00'));
  ```

- **TryUpdate**

  ```C#
  sqlite.Orders
  	.TryUpdate(x => x.Order_Details.Any(y => y.Discount >= 0.02))
      .Set(x => x.ShipCity, "Reims")
      .Save();
  ```

  ```sqlite
  UPDATE "Orders" SET "ShipCity"='Reims' WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM "Order Details" AS "y"
      WHERE ("y"."Discount" >= 0.02) AND ("Orders"."OrderID" = "y"."OrderID"));
  ```

  **Next feature**: to support set a value which is calculated by the specified entity ***x***.

- **TryDelete**

  ```C#
  sqlite.Orders
  	.TryDelete(x => x.Order_Details.Any(y => y.Discount >= 0.02))
      .Save();
  ```

  ```sqlite
  DELETE FROM "Orders" WHERE EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM "Order Details" AS "y"
      WHERE ("y"."Discount" >= 0.02) AND ("Orders"."OrderID" = "y"."OrderID"));
  ```
